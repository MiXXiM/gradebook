# Gradebook

Gradebook is a tool for managing assignments submitted via a GitHub repo, using tags to differentiate between assignments. The bulk of it was written over the course of about 6 hours, after I got really fed up with trying to use Google Spreadsheets to input grades.

## Features

- Automatic submission tracking via the Github API
- Supports assignment resubmission using version numbers
- Secure private links for students to view their grades
- Secure administrator login via Google OAuth
- Nice admin UI (Bootstrap)
